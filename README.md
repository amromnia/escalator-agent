# Counting People On Escalator Using Yolov8 and OpenCv from scratch

In this repository, codes have been implemented to count people who use escalator. For this purpose, I use OpenCV library and Yolo model.To go along with this repo, I also [wrote an article]() In order to implement step by step
from scratch.
- Step1: Download a sample video.I suggest you to download from [shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/) or [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
- step2: Making a mask for video. We have to specify the parts of the video that we want object detection to be done, and the rest of the video parts should not be processed. Therefore, we need to create a mask.The mask file I created is located in the image folder.
